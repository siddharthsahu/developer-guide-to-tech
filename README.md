# Developer guide to tech
A repo meant for developers as a quick reference guide on various technologies

# Run notebook

## Contribution
Project is divided into multiple techs

For each tech, write all notes in `scratchpad` initially, from where they should be moved to respective files

Each point should be with following points:
1. Heading
2. Description (Semi-formal definition)
3. Code (Code snippet)
4. Developer note
5. Further reading

Given sufficient points on a topic, divide tutorial into three levels, `basic`, `proficient` and `advanced`. If required, a separate note `installation` may be added for handling installation and setup help
